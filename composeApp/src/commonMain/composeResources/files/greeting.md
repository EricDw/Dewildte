__Welcome__ to my slice of the internet!
(If you are reading this then my custom-built Markdown parser is working!)

I built this website for you.
It's a showcase of what can be built by a single person using Compose Multiplatform.
I will be populating the website with various bits and bobs.

Here's a checklist of things I hope to put here: 

-[ ] Support for Markdown
-[ ] Resume
-[ ] Math Trainer

Enjoy your stay and beware the bugs...it's software after all ;)
